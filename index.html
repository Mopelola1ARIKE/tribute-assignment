    <p style="font-size:15px">I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones I <br>have loved
        them ever since the
        first one.
        Steve Jobs was a<br> great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and <br>go for and
        work with the apple
        when I get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow<br> by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than
        before it was. But I will <br>dearly miss Steve Jobs he’s a
        great man and I will <br>never forget him.<br></p>

    <p><b> So sad</b></p>
    <p style="font-size:15px"> As I heard this sad news via my iPhone I am emailing my condolences
        from<br> my MacBook Pro. Steve has left a fingerprint on our culture that cannot be<br> rivaled
        and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy to his family and<br> friends.</p>
    <p> Tracy</p>
    <P style="font-size:15px"> What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I’ve written <br>as an adult
        (and certainly
        every one that has been published),
        almost every<br> email I’ve ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I<br> interacted
        online using an Apple machine long before I even encountered a<br>
        PC Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid.<br> And through his vision, I
        have been able to realize my own. You’ll be<br> missed, Mr. Jobs.
        Thanks for all your amazing work.</P>

    <p style="font-size:15px">A part of my heart has cracked. I didn’t know him personally but I felt like I knew him.
        I<br> will forever
        remember him. I’m still saddened because he was<br> taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven
        has certainly<br> gained an angel. </p>

    <p style="font-size:15px"> Dear Steve’s family, dear Apple company I can’t find words how to describe<br> my
        feelings… For me Apple
        means a
        lot – I got a good job using Apple<br> products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of
        course, I’ve<br> been always
        admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is <br>connected with Steve. I do hope he’ll be
        remembered around the world as a<br> genius.</p>
